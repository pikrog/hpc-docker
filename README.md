# hpc-docker
Dockerized HPC cluster environment for convenient MPI application development.   
Inspired by [NLKNguyen/alpine-mpich](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/alpine-mpich).   
Provides dockerized MPICH and OpenMPI implementations available in both Debian and Alpine Linux. Example images:
- `pikrog/mpich:4.1.1-alpine` - MPICH 4.1.1 implementation installed in Alpine Linux,
- `pikrog/openmpi:4.1.5-bullseye` - OpenMPI 4.1.5 implementation installed in Debian Bullseye,
- `pikrog/mpich-node:1.0-alpine` - MPICH based cluster node in Alpine Linux,
- `pikrog/openmpi-node:1.0-bullseye` - OpenMPI based cluster node in Debian Bullseye.

# Use
You need to have an active [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) service running

## Setting up a local development environment
Open terminal. Make a new directory for the environment. Name it whatever you want, then switch to it.

    $ mkdir hpc
    $ cd hpc
    
Prepare a working directory. This directory will contain compiled MPI applications and will be shared amongst containers through a bind mount. Name it `workdir`.

    $ mkdir workdir
    
The working directory can be conveniently used to place source code files to be compiled later.

Download one of the compose files from this repository and optionally modify the configuration according to your needs. For example, you may want to select different MPI implementation (OpenMPI, MPICH) or base Linux distribution (Alpine, Debian). This can be done by changing the image name provided in the `image` nodes.

    $ wget -O compose.yml "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pikrog/mpich-docker/main/compose-mpich-alpine.yml"

Remember to rename this file to `compose.yml`. Otherwise you will need to specify the source compose file everytime when issuing `docker compose`:

    $ docker compose -f my-custom-compose.yml ...

Start the cluster in the background. Use `--scale worker=N` to adjust the number of worker nodes. In the example below, a cluster with four workers is created, which gives a total number of five nodes (including the master node).

    $ docker compose up -d --scale worker=4
    
Verify the cluster status.

    $ docker compose ps
    NAME              COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
    hpc-master-1      "run-cluster-node â€¦"     master              running             0.0.0.0:22->22/tcp
    hpc-worker-1      "/usr/sbin/sshd -D"      worker              running
    hpc-worker-2      "/usr/sbin/sshd -D"      worker              running
    hpc-worker-3      "/usr/sbin/sshd -D"      worker              running
    hpc-worker-4      "/usr/sbin/sshd -D"      worker              running

Open bash in the master node container.

    $ docker compose exec -it --user user master /bin/sh
     
... or open a SSH connection to it. First, download the private key located in this repository (`mpi-master/default_private_ssh_key`) or copy it from the master container.

    $ docker compose cp master:/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519 ./private_key
    
Then you can use the private key as the identity file.

    $ ssh user@localhost -i private_key
    50939476b988:~/mpi$

## Single node environment
In case you don't actually need multiple workers but just want to use the MPI dependencies (like the toolchain or the process executor), you can start a single container and immediately work with it. The command below starts a single container with the MPICH 4.1.1 implementation in Alpine Linux.

    $ docker run -it --rm pikrog/mpich:4.1.1-alpine
    / #

Note that the `--rm` switch causes the container to be automatically removed after exit. Omit this switch if this behavior is unwanted.
Alternatively, pass `-v` to attach a bind mount pointing to the working directory.

    $ docker run -it --rm -v /host/path/to/workdir:/container/path/to/workdir pikrog/mpich:4.1.1-latest

# Building the images
## Basis
The images available at Docker Hub are built on a specific platform. When a base image is built, selected MPI libraries source codes are downloaded and compiled. This causes the environment to be configured specifically for the host platform. Therefore, certain optimizations may be enabled (e.g. AVX2) that are usually unavailable on older processors making provided images unusable on some computers. On the other hand, some people might want to get optimizations that the publicly available images do not have. Also, the online images are built for the `x86-64` architecture. Last but not least, all `Dockerfiles` can be adjusted according to users' needs (e.g. supplied with extra non-standard dependencies installed). In these cases, images have to be built from scratch.    
## Steps
Clone this repository.

    $ git clone https://github.com/pikrog/hpc-docker
    
Change directory to the distribution you want to use as a base. For example, if you want to run cluster nodes within Debian Linux, go to the `debian` directory.

    $ cd debian
    
Modify the `.env` file if needed. This file can be used to update the MPI implementation or Linux distribution version to the latest. One can also modify the distribution image name. This can be used to pick a different platform architecture, e.g. `arm64`. The `.env` file below will cause the images to be built for `arm64` with the MPICH libraries downgraded to 4.0.2.

    MPICH_VERSION="4.0.2"
    OPENMPI_VERSION="4.1.5"
    BASE_DISTRO="arm64v8/debian:bullseye-20230522"
    BASE_DISTRO_TAG="arm64-bullseye"
    VERSION_TAG="1.1"

To build a cluster node image, two commands need to be issued.

    # This is only a template
    $ docker compose build [MPI_IMPLEMENTATION]
    $ docker compose build [MPI_IMPEMENTATION]-node

For example, if you want to build a cluster embed with MPICH implementation, issue these commands:

    $ docker compose build mpich
    $ docker compose build mpich-node

It is possible to modify some build arguments when executing the build command and affect the building process as a result. The example below depicts how to select a different link from which the MPICH source code will be downloaded.

    $ docker compose build --build-arg MPICH_SOURCE_LINK=https://somewebiste.com/mpich.tar mpich
